# Real-time Natural Disaster Monitoring and Response System

## Introduction

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires are unpredictable and can cause extensive damage to property and loss of life. Real-time natural disaster monitoring and response systems play a critical role in mitigating the effects of these disasters by providing up-to-date information to emergency responders and the public. This document outlines the standards and guidelines for contributing to the development of a real-time natural disaster monitoring and response system.

# Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish a set of guidelines for developers, engineers, and data scientists to follow when contributing to the development of a real-time natural disaster monitoring and response system. The guidelines aim to ensure that the system is robust, reliable, and capable of providing timely information to emergency responders and the public.
