# Real-time Natural Disaster Monitoring and Response System

## Introduction

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires are unpredictable and can cause extensive damage to property and loss of life. Real-time natural disaster monitoring and response systems play a critical role in mitigating the effects of these disasters by providing up-to-date information to emergency responders and the public. This document outlines the standards and guidelines for contributing to the development of a real-time natural disaster monitoring and response system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish a set of guidelines for developers, engineers, and data scientists to follow when contributing to the development of a real-time natural disaster monitoring and response system. The guidelines aim to ensure that the system is robust, reliable, and capable of providing timely information to emergency responders and the public.

## System Architecture

The real-time natural disaster monitoring and response system is a complex system that consists of several components. The system architecture is designed to ensure that the system is scalable, reliable, and can handle large amounts of data. The system components include:

### Data Acquisition Component
This component is responsible for collecting data from various sources, including sensors, satellite imagery, and social media. The data collected is then processed to generate real-time information about the disaster.
