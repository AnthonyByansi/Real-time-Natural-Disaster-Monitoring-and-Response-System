# Real-time Natural Disaster Monitoring and Response System

The Real-time Natural Disaster Monitoring and Response System is a big data application designed to monitor and respond to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires. The system collects data from various sources, including weather sensors, satellite imagery, social media, news reports, and emergency services, and uses big data analysis to identify patterns and trends that may indicate a natural disaster.

## Features

* **Real-time data collection and storage using Apache Kafka and Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**
* Pre-processing of data using Apache Nifi to remove noise, perform quality checks, and normalize the data

* Big data analysis using machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and patterns in the data
* Interactive visualization of data using Tableau and D3.js to create maps, charts, and graphs that show real-time data on natural disasters

## Requirements

To run the Real-time Natural Disaster Monitoring and Response System, you will need:

* Apache Kafka for real-time data collection and processing
* Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for data storage
* Apache Nifi for data pre-processing
* Apache Spark for big data analysis
* Tableau or D3.js for data visualization

## Getting Started

To get started with the Real-time Natural Disaster Monitoring and Response System, follow these steps:
* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Install the required software (Apache Kafka, HDFS, Nifi, Spark, Tableau or D3.js)
* Configure the system to collect data from your chosen sources (weather sensors, satellite imagery, social media, news reports, and emergency services)
* Run the system and monitor the real-time data on natural disasters
* Configure the system to send automated alerts to emergency services when a natural disaster is detected
